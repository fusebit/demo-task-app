## How do I integrate Fusebit into my SaaS app?

</br>

We built this sample app to **help you answer** this question.

Please explore this codebase to understand how the different pieces work under the hood. Additionally, you can also use this as a companion app while you build out your integration in Fusebit before you migrate it fully into your own product.

## ðŸ’» Installation

1. Create a .env file from the [example file](https://github.com/fusebit/demo-task-app/blob/main/.env.example)
2. Run `npm run-script build`
3. Run `node .`

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

To change the primary color of the sample app, use the `primary` query param followed by a hex color without the #, for example: https://task-sample-app.on.fusebit.io/?primary=333333

To change the secondary color of the sample app, use the `secondary` query param followed by a hex color without the #, for example: https://task-sample-app.on.fusebit.io/?secondary=3F51B5

If you want to change both of them at the same time, you can do it like so: https://task-sample-app.on.fusebit.io/?primary=333333&secondary=3F51B5

The default primary color is #333333, and the default secondary color is #3F51B5.

The primary color will be reflected almost everywhere on the sample app, unless that color is set to #ffffff.

In case the primary color is #ffffff (white), we will use the secondary color on the buttons, the marketplace tiles and on the login page instead of the primary color to prevent the primary color to intervene with the sample app background color.

If the primary color is different to white, the secondary color will only be used to change the secondary user avatar color and as a detail color on some hover or focus states.

To change the logo, drag and drop your logo on the box that says `Drag your logo here` or click on the box and select the logo you desire to set.

If you want to change the logo again after you have set it, either drag and drop your new logo on the old logo and you'll see that the logo will dissapear and the drop box that says `Drag your logo here` will render again, or click on the logo and a prompt to select a new logo will show up.

All of the customization preferences will be saved in localstorage.

To open localstorage in Chrome, press F12 or right click on the website, click inspect, and go to the Application tab. Then, on the left you will see a section titled Storage, below that title it will say Local Storage. Press the arrow on the left of Local Storage to expand it, and then right click on the website url to see all of the keys.

The colors will be saved under the `colors` key. If you want to set the colors back to the default value, right click on the `colors` key and then click on `delete`.

The logo will be saved under the `logo` key. If you want to remove the logo, right click on the `logo` key and then click on `delete`.

The helpers will be disabled by default if the colors are customized. You will see them under the `disableHelpers` key if they are disabled. You don't need to remove this key, if you remove the colors preference, the `disableHelpers` key will be automatically removed and the helpers will be visible again.

The `configuration` key is a JWT we use to get your account information, for example your user ID, account ID, and subscription ID. Do not remove this key.

The `users` key is an object that contains the users data. We mostly use this key to store the custom user names, so if you delete this key and then log out, you'll see that the user names will roll back to `Tenant 1` and `Tenant 2`.
